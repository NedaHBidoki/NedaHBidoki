An approach is developed to integrate the complementary benefits of digitized assessments and
peer learning. The research hypothesis is that each student’s assessment data at the fine-grained
resolution of correct/incorrect question choice selections can be utilized to partition learners into
effective peer learning cohorts. A low overhead approach is explored along with its associated
tool, referred to as Automated Peer Learning Cohorts (Auto-PLC). The objective of Auto-PLC is
to increase scalability to deliver peer-based learning. First, digitized formative assessments are
delivered in a computer-based testing center. This enables automated grading, which frees-up the
instructor’s and teaching assistants’ workloads to become reallocated to recitation sessions for
higher-gain learning activities, such as peer-based remediation sessions. Second, within the
recitations held following each formative quiz, students are afforded an opportunity to complete

a remedial assignment. Auto-graded results of formative assessment submissions undergo Auto-
PLC’s statistical clustering routines using Excel macros and Python scripts to partition the class

into four-person peer learning cohorts having mutually-complementary knowledge gaps and skill
efficacies. Within each peer learning cohort, students solve together an assigned remedial
problem during the recitation session. Thus, students who have already acquired a particular skill
become paired together with students who are still acquiring that same skill, and vice versa. This
also aids scalability to large enrollments within Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and
Computer Science (CS) courses by maximizing opportunities for students to teach each other the
material which they still need to learn.
