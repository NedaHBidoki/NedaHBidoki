We consider wireless sensor networks that nodes offload data to a central collector node (sink) via wireless communication. Sensed data are associated with a value, decaying in time. In this scenario, we address the problem of finding the path of sensed data so that the Value of Information (VoI) of the data delivered to a sink is maximized while keeping energy usage as low as possible. Sleep scheduling is a widely used technique in MAC-layer to reduce unnecessary idle energy consumption in WSN; however, when it is carried out without paying attention to network-layer routing, it may adversely affect sensed data value of information. In this paper, we employ linear programming (LP) to establish a paradigm of cross-layer formulation to capture the interplay between scheduling and routing. We propose a biobjective model of data value of information maximization and energy cost minimization in a WSN.
