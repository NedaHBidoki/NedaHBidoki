This research developed an approach to integrate the complementary benefits of digitized assessments and peer learning. Its basic premise and associated hypotheses are that by using student assessments of correct and incorrect quiz answers using a fine-grained resolution to pair them into remediation peer-learning cohorts is an effective means of learning. Delivered and scored in a computer-based testing center, the assessment of digitized formative quizzes paired students whose scores indicated a different knowledge skill level so that by the end of the same week as the quiz, the paired students cooperatively took an in-class quiz during a remediation session to determine if there were any learning improvements. This research article discusses this research approach and presents the findings.
