Description
============

Social media users exhibit repetitive behavior patterns that can be leveraged to predict trends in network evolution. Additionally, different social platforms have many users in common and are influenced by common events occurring in the real world. As such, it is likely that they exhibit similar trends. We use sampling, time series analysis and deep learning techniques to capture the internal and external correlations and predict the future features of the networks.
