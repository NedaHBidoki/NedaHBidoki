Descirption
===========


Many real dataset come in network/graph format. Although the expressive strength of deep learning methods are very wel recognized in extracting the hidden undelying patterns, they cannot be directly applied to graphs. Graph Convolutional Networks has been propsed to customize the deep learning framework for irregular structure of graphs.  We employed GCNs to investigate how observed human variables such as their tweets in a social network data sets can be used within the social network structure to determine user properties.
