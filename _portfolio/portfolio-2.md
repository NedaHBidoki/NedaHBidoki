Burst analysis and prediction is a fundamental problem in social network analysis, since user activities have been shown to have an intrinsically bursty nature.  Bursts may also be a signal of topics that are of growing real-world interest.

A model is proposed in order to capture the temporal dependencies and associations based upon activity information.
