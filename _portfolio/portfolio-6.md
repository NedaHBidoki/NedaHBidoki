The research hypothesis is that each studentâ€™s assessment data at the fine-grained
resolution of correct/incorrect question choice selections can be utilized to partition learners into
effective peer learning cohorts. A low overhead approach is explored along with its associated
tool, referred to as Automated Peer Learning Cohorts (Auto-PLC). The objective of Auto-PLC is
to increase scalability to deliver peer-based learning.
